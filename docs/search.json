    "text": "My Picture\n\n\nMy name is Zaara Faruqui, and I am a student at the University of Waterloo. I am currently in my fourth year, majoring in Honours Psychology with a minor in Legal Studies.\nI have always been interested in psychology, ever since middle school. There are so many areas I want to learn more about, and it’s hard to choose just one! For example, I find behavioural psychology really intriguing because I like trying to understand the human mind and why people behave the way they do. I am also interested in social psychology, which looks at the dynamics between people, such as relationships between family members, partners, friends, and more. When I meet new people, I want to understand their story and who they really are. I often take note of personality traits and how they might connect to something they mention about their experiences or background. Helping people is also really important to me. I always wanted a career where I can support others and make a positive impact, especially for those who are struggling.\nPsychology itself is such a fascinating field to me. I feel like studying it allows you to better understand people and help them, while it is also useful in many areas of life, both personally and professionally. As for my own career goals, I am drawn to multiple areas of psychology. After graduating from the University of Waterloo, I plan to either continue my studies in grad school to get a Master’s and work as a clinical psychologist, or go to med school to become a psychiatrist.\nMy goal for this year is to study and work as hard as I can to achieve the best grades in my classes, while really taking in the material so I can apply it to my real life. I also want to meet and collaborate with people in my classes, because working with others not only improves my work but also helps build friendships along the way.\nOutside of university and studying, I have a bunch of hobbies and interests. I really enjoy puzzle games like Sudoku and word searches, as well as activities like working out and dancing! I also like watching movies and TV shows, and creating lists where I rank and review them. My relationships are very important to me, so I like to spend most of my time with my family and closest friends."

    "section": "",
    "text": "My First Post\n I came to Canada in 2012 from Saudi Arabia, where I was born and raised. Ethnically, I am Indian. Based on the way my parents described Canada, it sounded like a dream: playing in the snow (something I had never seen before), enjoying the beautiful nature and variety of animals, and experiencing all the new opportunities for me and my family. I was eight years old when I arrived, and while I was excited to live in a new building “with a swimming pool and mini-bowling,” I was also a little scared. I worried that leaving all my friends behind would mean that I would struggle to make new ones, and at first, that is exactly what happened.\nStarting at a new elementary school in the middle of the year was overwhelming. Everyone already knew each other, and I was not only joining a new class but also navigating a completely different school system than what I was used to in Saudi Arabia.\n The first year was a challenge. I attended a school in Brampton and saw many different people, some of them being Indian like me. I tried to push my worries aside, hoping that our shared background might help me make friends. But that was not the case. I felt a gap between myself and my classmates because of the cultural differences. The lunches I brought from home were very different from theirs, and I did not know much about Canadian pop culture. Listening to the kids talk about celebrities and TV shows I had never heard of, I struggled to find anything to connect over.\nOver time, I started to understand the culture better. I watched Canadian TV, listened to new music, and observed how my classmates interacted. Slowly, I began learning the unwritten rules of friendship in this new environment, and I managed to make some friends. I thought that changing myself to fit in would finally allow me to belong.\n It wasn’t until I moved from Brampton to Mississauga that I realized I had been looking at it the wrong way. I did not have to be like everyone else to be accepted. On my first day in my new grade 4 class, I made friends almost immediately. People were welcoming and genuinely wanted to be friends without me having to show off my “new knowledge.” My school years became much easier, and I gradually overcame the feeling of being out of place in a foreign environment.\nFourteen years later, I feel like I have truly become Canadian, while still embracing my Saudi and Indian roots. As a student at the University of Waterloo, I really appreciate how inclusive it is and how many people come from different places. Through my classes, I have met students who are experiencing the same challenges I faced when I first arrived, which brings me back to how I felt in the beginning. It really frustrates me to see the negativity aimed at international students and immigrants. My family and I came to Canada to build a better life, and fortunately, we were able to do so. Everyone deserves the chance to do the same and pursue what is best for them. I hope that as time goes by, people become more accepting of each other and we can all live together peacefully while embracing our diversity.  —"
