    "text": "Welcome to my website!\n\n\n\nMy Picture\n\n\nMy name is Zaara Faruqui, and I am a student at the University of Waterloo. I am currently in my fourth year, majoring in Honours Psychology with a minor in Legal Studies.\nI have always been interested in psychology, ever since middle school. There are so many areas I want to learn more about, and it’s hard to choose just one! For example, I find behavioural psychology really intriguing because I like trying to understand the human mind and why people behave the way they do. I am also interested in social psychology, which looks at the dynamics between people, such as relationships between family members, partners, friends, and more. When I meet new people, I want to understand their story and who they really are. I often take note of personality traits and how they might connect to something they mention about their experiences or background. Helping people is also really important to me. I always wanted a career where I can support others and make a positive impact, especially for those who are struggling.\nPsychology itself is such a fascinating field to me. I feel like studying it allows you to better understand people and help them, while it is also useful in many areas of life, both personally and professionally. As for my own career goals, I am drawn to multiple areas of psychology. After graduating from the University of Waterloo, I plan to either continue my studies in grad school to get a Master’s and work as a clinical psychologist, or go to med school to become a psychiatrist.\nMy goal for this year is to study and work as hard as I can to achieve the best grades in my classes, while really taking in the material so I can apply it to my real life. I also want to meet and collaborate with people in my classes, because working with others not only improves my work but also helps build friendships along the way.\nOutside of university and studying, I have a bunch of hobbies and interests. I really enjoy puzzle games like Sudoku and word searches, as well as activities like working out and dancing! I also like watching movies and TV shows, and creating lists where I rank and review them. My relationships are very important to me, so I like to spend most of my time with my family and closest friends."
