# My First Post

I came to Canada in 2012 from Saudi Arabia, where I was born and raised. Ethnically, I am Indian. Based on the way my parents described Canada, it sounded like a dream: playing in the snow (something I had never seen before), enjoying the beautiful nature and variety of animals, and experiencing all the new opportunities for me and my family. I was eight years old when I arrived, and while I was excited to live in a new building “with a swimming pool and mini-bowling,” I was also a little scared. I worried that leaving all my friends behind would mean that I would struggle to make new ones, and at first, that is exactly what happened.

Starting at a new elementary school in the middle of the year was overwhelming. Everyone already knew each other, and I was not only joining a new class but also navigating a completely different school system than what I was used to in Saudi Arabia.

The first year was a challenge. I attended a school in Brampton and saw many different people, some of them being Indian like me. I tried to push my worries aside, hoping that our shared background might help me make friends. But that was not the case. I felt a gap between myself and my classmates because of the cultural differences. The lunches I brought from home were very different from theirs, and I did not know much about Canadian pop culture. Listening to the kids talk about celebrities and TV shows I had never heard of, I struggled to find anything to connect over.

Over time, I started to understand the culture better. I watched Canadian TV, listened to new music, and observed how my classmates interacted. Slowly, I began learning the unwritten rules of friendship in this new environment, and I managed to make some friends. I thought that changing myself to fit in would finally allow me to belong.

It wasn’t until I moved from Brampton to Mississauga that I realized I had been looking at it the wrong way. I did not have to be like everyone else to be accepted. On my first day in my new grade 4 class, I made friends almost immediately. People were welcoming and genuinely wanted to be friends without me having to show off my “new knowledge.” My school years became much easier, and I gradually overcame the feeling of being out of place in a foreign environment.

Fourteen years later, I feel like I have truly become Canadian, while still embracing my Saudi and Indian roots. As a student at the University of Waterloo, I really appreciate how inclusive it is and how many people come from different places. Through my classes, I have met students who are experiencing the same challenges I faced when I first arrived, which brings me back to how I felt in the beginning. It really frustrates me to see the negativity aimed at international students and immigrants. My family and I came to Canada to build a better life, and fortunately, we were able to do so. Everyone deserves the chance to do the same and pursue what is best for them. I hope that as time goes by, people become more accepting of each other and we can all live together peacefully while embracing our diversity.
